# Voxelizer for Additive Manufacutring (VOX4AM)
Voxelizer for Additive Manufacutring (VOX4AM) was firstly developed to generate voxelization data for training convolutional neural network (CNN) models that estimate build time for AM. VOX4AM gets more than one mesh files as OBJ format (.obj) and produces a Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file (.h5). Unlike other conventional voxelizers, VOX4AM takes the build space into consideration because the volume ratio between a mesh model and a build space is a key factor that affcts the build time.
